					<br>
					//  find a loaf of pre-sliced bread in the pantry
					<br>
					//  find peanut butter in the pantry (I like smoove Skippy)
					<br>
					//  find jelly in the fridge (I like raspberry)
					<br>
					//  find a butterknife in your kitchen
					<br>
					//  put two slices of bread on a plate
					<br>
					//  open the peanut butter and jelly jars
					<br>
					//  use your butterknife and scoop out some peanut butter
					<br>
					//  spread peanut butter generously on one piece of bread
					<br>
					//  clean off your butterknife
					<br>
					//  use your butterknife and scoop out some jelly
					<br>
					//  spread jelly generously on the other piece of bread
					<br>
					//  clean off your butterknife again
					<br>
					//  close lids of peanut butter and jelly jars
					<br>
					//  put the rest of the loaf and the peanut butter back in the pantry
					<br>
					//  put the jelly back in the fridge
					<br>
					//  put the two sides of bread together, so that the peanut butter and jelly are touching
					<br>
					//  take your clean butterknife and slice diagonally through the sandwich
					<br>
					//  take a bite and enjoy :)
